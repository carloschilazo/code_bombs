CodeBombs: MAXIMIZE LULZ(REALLY EVIL)
===============================

Things that if included into a C or C++ project, will do some very weird stuff.

Good for some prank, bad because will turn debugging into a nightmare if it is well hidden.


Usage
------
Include one of the .h files into your code base, rename it to avoid suspicion

License
-------
Use it at your own risk\n
